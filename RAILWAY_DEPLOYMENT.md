## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Bot Not Starting?

- Go to Railway → Variables
- Verify `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` is set correctly
- No quotes needed in Railway UI

**Check 2: Build Logs**
- Go to Deployments → Latest
- Click "Build Logs"
- Look for errors during `pip install`

**Check 3: Deploy Logs**  
- Click "Deploy Logs"
- Should see: "🤖 Starting Telegram Bot..."
- If not, check for Python errors

---

### Bot Started But Not Responding?

**Check 1: Bot Token**
- Verify token is correct in Railway Variables
- Test token with: `curl https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getMe`

**Check 2: BotFather Settings**
- Open @BotFather on Telegram
- Send `/mybots`
- Select your bot
- Make sure it's not disabled

**Check 3: Railway Logs**
- Check for error messages
- Look for "ConnectionError" or "Timeout"

---

### Bot Crashing/Restarting?

**Check Deploy Logs:**
```bash
# Common issues:

1. Module not found
   → Check requirements.txt has all packages
   
2. TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN not found
   → Add variable in Railway dashboard

3. Memory exceeded
   → Upgrade to larger plan ($10/month = 1GB RAM)
   
4. Rate limiting from Yahoo Finance
   → Normal during market hours, bot will retry
```
