# Note: This workflow is OPTIONAL
# - Streamlit free tier sleeps after 7 days of no activity
# - If you use the app daily, you don't need this
# - If you want guaranteed uptime, this helps
# - Alternatively, use UptimeRobot (free) instead

# To enable this workflow:
# 1. Replace "your-app.streamlit.app" with your actual URL
# 2. Commit and push to GitHub
# 3. GitHub Actions will run automatically
